# Fantomsign smart contract

The original hardhat project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

This project has been adapted to create a system of record for document signings on the Fantom networks using the contract here: https://github.com/cbonoz/fantom23/blob/main/contracts/contracts/SignatureContract.sol


Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat help
```
